## Viper Architecture
Viper is one of the architectures I like the most. I normally choose the architecture according to the size of the project and the time I have to develop it. In this case, although the project is small, I have used it to carry out unit and UI tests.

## Frameworks
- [IQKeyboardManager](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/tree/master/IQKeyboardManagerSwift): I have used this third party library because it facilitates the development of screens where there are textfields, for handling opening and closing keyboard animation.
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa): I used Realm as database for the simplicity of its development. I could have used CoreData for example but I think that even being a third party library is much easier to use.

## Unit Tests & UI Tests
I have developed a few tests of each type as an example.

## Compile Instructions
You have to install frameworks with Carthage.
